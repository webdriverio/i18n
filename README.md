# i18n

Translation files for the WebdriverIO documentation, including a script that pulls the latest docs from the main repository and runs through a Large Language Model (LLM) to translate them.

## Usage

After cloning this repository, create a `.env` file with the following secret keys required for pulling the source translation and translating them:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
GITHUB_TOKEN=...
```

Then kick off the translation script:

```sh
npm start
```

Note: the script is [caching](/src/cache.json) the translations per language, running it without cache may cost you a lot of LLM usage.

## Supported Languages

As noted in [`constants.ts`](/src/constants.ts), we currently translate into the following languages:

 - de
 - es
 - fr
 - it
 - ja
 - ko
 - nl
 - pl
 - pt
 - ru
 - tr
 - zh

If you like your language supported as well, please raise a PR.
