# i18n

Translation files for the WebdriverIO documentation, including a script that pulls the latest docs from the main repository and runs through a Large Language Model (LLM) to translate them.

## Usage

After cloning this repository, create a `.env` file with the following secret keys required for pulling the source translation and translating them:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
GITHUB_TOKEN=...
```

Then kick off the translation script:

```sh
npm start
```

Note: the script is [caching](/src/cache.json) the translations per language, running it without cache may cost you a lot of LLM usage.
